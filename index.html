    <p>Really a boring teacher lecturing is a worst thing that one would ever
      exprience, first when you sitting at the back of the desk and you are a
      slow learner which is really not good
      Having a boring teacher you would never get the psyche to continuing
      studying its like, he/she doesnt
      show you the meaning about the what you are learning
